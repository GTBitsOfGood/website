> The official landing site for Bits of Good üöÄ

## Tech stack breakdown

The bits of good landing page is built on some modern tooling to keep everything nice and future-proof. Let's dive into what we're using.

### Our frontend framework: SvelteJS

Everything you see is built on [SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev), a component-based framework that magically disappears ‚ú® There are countless reasons we chose this framework, as it brings a host of benefits for decreasing bundle size and load times. However, we mainly chose it because of how easy the syntax is to understand! You can read more [here](https://dev.to/bholmesdev/why-sveltejs-may-be-the-best-framework-for-new-web-devs-205i) to learn why it's so awesome, or just [dive into the docs](https://svelte.dev/docs) to start experimenting yourself.

**UPDATE 2025**: This project was originally built with Sapper, which is now deprecated in favor of SvelteKit. This project has now been migrated. If you encounter any inconsistencies, please report them. Some SvelteKit features might not be fully taken advantage of. Understand that this is a result of the migration and any optimization and future development is welcome.

#### Sapper

Along with Svelte, we are using [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) to make wiring everything up a bit easier. Mainly, Sapper provides:

- Automatic client-side routing out of the box. Basically, any component in the `src/routes` directory becomes its own page you can link to using a regular old `<a>` tag!
- Preloading of information before loading the page. This makes it easy to fetch our website's text content and other resources before the initial page load.
- Spinning up a server to serve all our pages, complete with server-side rendering!

### Our site content: Contentful

For basically every text field you see on the site, we're fetching it using [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). This is a [headless CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained) that allows us to host all of our images, text, markdown, etc. in one place.

This is a huge benefit for our designers, who can now just edit a textbox or upload an image to see it appear on the site!

## Install Dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Set up Contentful content model

For external contributors or contributors that don't have access to Bits of Good's Contentful API key, you can run the `seed-contentful` script to seed a [data export](./contentful/export.json) into your own Contentful account

Script Usage: `yarn seed-contentful`

This command will ask you for a space ID, and access tokens for the Contentful Management and Delivery API. It will import the data export into your Contentful space and create a local `.env` with environment variables to retrieve data from Contentful.

## Start up the site

If you're working in development, run the following to build + run the site with live reloading goodness:

```sh
yarn dev
```

For production builds, run the following to build and start the site:

```sh
yarn build && yarn preview
```

## Run the tests

This site uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for thorough end-to-end testing. To start up the testing environment, you can run:

```sh
yarn test
```

This will start the server and open Cypress. You can (and should!) add tests in `cypress/integration/spec.js` ‚Äî consult the [Cypress docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell) for more information.
